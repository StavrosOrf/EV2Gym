# this yml file is used to configure the evsim simulation

# Simulation Parameters
  timescale: 15 # in minutes per step
  simulation_length: 25 # in steps per simulation

# Date:
# Year, month, and day change after the envrionment has been reset
  year: 2022 # 2015-2023
  month: 1 # 1-12
  day: 17 # 1-31
  
# Simulation Starting Time 
  hour: 8 # Simulation starting hour (24 hour format)
  minute: 0 # Simulation starting minute (0-59)
  # Hour and minute do not change after the environment has been reset

# Charging Topology
  number_of_charging_stations: 2
  number_of_transformers: 1
  number_of_ports_per_cs: 1
  # Provide path if you want to load a specific charging topology, 
  # else write None for a randomized one with the above parameters
  charging_network_topology: None #./config_files/charging_topology_10.json

# EV Specifications
  heterogeneous_ev_specs: False #if False, each EV has its own specifications
  # such as battery capacity, charging rate, etc.

# EV Spawn Behavior
  scenario: workplace # public, private, or workplace
  spawn_multiplier: 15 # 1 is default, the higher the number the more EVs spawn
  score_threshold: 0 # user satsifcation threshold for the game to end (0 -> never ends)
